A single page website implemented using Bootstrap.

This is a singe page website, based on the design guidelines of GDG VIT Vellore's (old) website with subtle improvements in elements and responsiveness, implemented in Bootstrap. For learning experience.

It involves using certain components of Bootstrap so that the website is always Mobile-first. The original GDG VIT website was drawn using MaterializeCSS, and some elements of responsiveness were not well written. However it resulted in a much lengthier code but such issues have been taken care of, and components like Scrollspy have been added to make the UX better.

This was a learning exercise that I did to get started with Front-end Web frameworks and since Bootstrap is one of the more popular ones, this was a wonderful little project to recreate an exact copy of a website using Bootstrap.
